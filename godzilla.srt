00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:38,085
Or why these creatures
shouldn't be exterminated.

169
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:39,754
Monarch was tasked

170
00:11:39,756 --> 00:11:42,892
with finding and destroying
these radioactive monsters.

171
00:11:42,894 --> 00:11:45,127
But you either can't
or won't tell us

172
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:48,697
how many there are
or why they're showing up.

173
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:51,667
So, maybe it's time for
the military to put them down.

174
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,734
[Serizawa] Killing them
would be a mistake.

175
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:55,904
They returned because of us.

176
00:11:55,906 --> 00:12:00,209
It was our atomic testing
that awoke <i>Gojira.</i>

177
00:12:00,211 --> 00:12:02,378
Other creatures like the MUTOs

178
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,446
from strip mining
and seismic surveys.

179
00:12:05,448 --> 00:12:07,816
But these are not monsters.

180
00:12:07,818 --> 00:12:09,819
They are animals
rising to reclaim

181
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:11,485
a world that was once theirs.

182
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:12,854
It almost sounds like

183
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:14,956
you're protecting them,
Doctor Serizawa.

184
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,457
As if you admire them.

185
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:19,561
I admire all forms of life.

186
00:12:19,563 --> 00:12:22,697
Senators,
if we hope to survive,

187
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:26,401
we must find ways
to coexist with Titans.

188
00:12:26,403 --> 00:12:28,670
With <i>Gojira.</i>

189
00:12:28,672 --> 00:12:31,038
[Dr. Graham] A sort of
symbiotic relationship,

190
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,141
if you will.

191
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:34,777
Like the lion and the mouse.

192
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:37,378
Or the scorpion and the frog.

193
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,114
So you'd want to
make Godzilla our pet?

194
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:41,582
No.

195
00:12:41,584 --> 00:12:43,350
We will be his.

196

[Chuckles nervously]

199
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:52,259
That's not what
Doctor Serizawa meant.

200
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:53,494
[Whispers] We have to go.

201
00:12:53,496 --> 00:12:55,029
No one is implying
that we would be

202
00:12:55,031 --> 00:12:56,665
- Godzilla's or anyone's pet.
- Sam, we have to go.

203
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:58,234
[Williams] Doctor Serizawa,
Doctor Graham,

204
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,567
this hearing is not adjourned.

205
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:01,903
Doctor Serizawa,
I hope you understand

206
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:05,606
the consequences
of walking out that door.

207
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:06,908
Uh, you know what, Senators,

208
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,409
while I confer
with my colleagues here,

209
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:09,811
I'm gonna set you up
with a very brief

210
00:13:09,813 --> 00:13:11,412
and pretty fun documentary

211
00:13:11,414 --> 00:13:13,148
on Titan reproduction.

212
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,950
I think this is the one where
the genitals are blurred out.

213
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:18,586
But if not, you can leave
a comment with my assistant.

214
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:20,390

[Dr. Graham]
The feed cuts out there.

220
00:14:22,251 --> 00:14:24,552
The survivors
haven't been able to give us

221
00:14:24,554 --> 00:14:26,888
much more
than what the footage allows.

222
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,628
Only that Emma and Madison
were the only ones taken.

223
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:32,994
I'm sorry, Mark.

224
00:14:32,996 --> 00:14:35,533
I should've been there
for her.

225
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,499
Who are they?

226
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:39,770
We don't know yet.

227
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:44,107
We believe
they were after this.

228
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,243
You didn't.

229
00:14:48,245 --> 00:14:49,710
[Sam] It's the ORCA.

230
00:14:49,712 --> 00:14:51,312
Uh, that's why we think
they need Emma.

231
00:14:51,314 --> 00:14:53,849
She believed that
if we could somehow replicate

232
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,883
the biosonar the Titans
use to communicate...

233
00:14:55,885 --> 00:14:58,125
I know what the hell it is.
I helped build the prototype.

234
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:00,755
Who is he?

235
00:15:00,757 --> 00:15:03,090
Uh, Sam Coleman.
I'm the head of technology.

236
00:15:03,092 --> 00:15:05,761
I joined Monarch,
uh, shortly after you left.

237
00:15:05,763 --> 00:15:07,196
I'm a big fan of your wife...

238
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,564
...'s work. And you.

239
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:10,231
That just came out so weird,
I'm sorry.

240
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:12,099
Emma and I destroyed
the prototype.

241
00:15:12,101 --> 00:15:15,037
And then Emma decided
to rebuild it.

242
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,471
After San Francisco,
she went home to Boston,

243
00:15:17,473 --> 00:15:18,940
spent years developing it.

244
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:20,341
She thought it could help...

245
00:15:20,343 --> 00:15:21,743
Would help what? Play God?

246
00:15:21,745 --> 00:15:23,778
[Dr. Graham] No.
Help prevent another attack.

247
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,345
ORCA was a grad school
science project.

248
00:15:25,347 --> 00:15:27,449
It was meant to keep whales
away from the shoreline.

249
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:29,683
Not so you could talk to your
little creatures out there.

250
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:32,854
Listen to me, they'll think
it's one of them.

251
00:15:32,856 --> 00:15:35,824
You use the wrong frequency
on one of 'em

252
00:15:35,826 --> 00:15:37,658
and you're
gonna be responsible

253
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,628
for 1,000 San Franciscos.

254
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,064
Which is why we need
to get it back.

255
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,633
Emma always said no one knew
the ORCA better than you.

256
00:15:45,635 --> 00:15:47,835
It shouldn't even exist.

257
00:15:47,837 --> 00:15:49,204
[Sam] That may be, Mark.

258
00:15:49,206 --> 00:15:51,138
But it's fallen
into the wrong hands.

259
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,676
And right now,
the ORCA is the only thing

260
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:56,412
keeping
Emma and Madison alive.

261
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,413
Mark, we know you're hurting.

262
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,952
But if we find the ORCA,
we'll find your family.

263
00:16:03,286 --> 00:16:04,955
I promise.

<i>you spoke to Emma?</i>

266
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,270
About three years ago.

267
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:21,802
After San Francisco,

268
00:16:21,804 --> 00:16:23,808
we went back home to Boston.

269
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:28,442
Tried to put
the pieces back together.

270
00:16:28,444 --> 00:16:32,681
Emma dealt with it by doubling
down on saving the world

271
00:16:32,683 --> 00:16:34,585
and I started drinking.

272
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:38,787
I can't tell you
how much I hated myself

273
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,158
for letting Maddie see me
that way.

274
00:16:43,593 --> 00:16:45,060
Uh, you mind
if we cut in here?

275
00:16:45,062 --> 00:16:48,265
It's just,
you're gonna wanna see this.

276
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:51,832
Emma combined the bioacoustics

277
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:55,070
of different Titans
to create the ORCA's signal.

278
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:56,904
A sort of baseline frequency

279
00:16:56,906 --> 00:16:58,974
that all the creatures
respond to.

280
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,942
Attracting them,
repelling them,

281
00:17:00,944 --> 00:17:03,911
even at times
calming them down.

282
00:17:03,913 --> 00:17:05,914
It's pretty remarkable
actually.

283
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,014
[Dr. Graham] The problem is
we don't know

284
00:17:07,016 --> 00:17:08,449
which Titans she combined.

285
00:17:08,451 --> 00:17:10,985
But if you can identify
those frequencies,

286
00:17:10,987 --> 00:17:13,455
we'll be able
to track the ORCA

287
00:17:13,457 --> 00:17:15,724
and find Emma and Madison.

288

[Mark] Jesus!

289
00:17:17,794 --> 00:17:19,727
How many of these things
are there?

290
00:17:19,729 --> 00:17:23,064
Seventeen and counting
after <i>Gojira.</i>

291
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:24,398
Seventeen?

292
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,000
Most of them were discovered
in deep hibernation.

293

While others we've contained

294

around the globe.

296

We even found one in Wyoming.

297
00:17:35,278 --> 00:17:36,544
They're everywhere.

298

Why don't you kill 'em?

299

The government wants to.

300
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:44,087
But Emma and I believe
some are benevolent.

328
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,425
he began trafficking
in a new and dangerous market.

329

330
00:19:32,195 --> 00:19:34,161
What the hell is someone gonna
do with a giant worm?

331
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:35,763
[Rick] Are you kidding,
Martinez?

332
00:19:35,765 --> 00:19:37,232
What can't you do with it?

333
00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:39,301
Pharmaceuticals,
bioweapons, food...

334
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,404
Hell, there isn't a country
or a company on the planet

335
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:44,304
that doesn't wanna get its
hands on one of these suckers.

336
00:19:44,306 --> 00:19:47,542
And remember,
this is just a larva.

337
00:19:47,544 --> 00:19:48,776
That's a baby.

338
00:19:48,778 --> 00:19:50,811
After it cocoons,

339
00:19:50,813 --> 00:19:52,213
something else
is gonna crawl out.

340
00:19:52,215 --> 00:19:54,983
Something bigger, meaner...

341
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,685
- We don't know that, Rick.
- [Rick] Oh, yeah?

342
00:19:56,687 --> 00:19:58,721
Just wait for it, Chen.

343
00:19:58,723 --> 00:20:01,156
Our intel indicates
that Jonah wants

344

to capture this specimen.

345
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:04,158
Alive.

346
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,328
Which means that he and his
mercs won't be far behind.

347
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,696
At 0500, we'll ship out
to launch a joint operation...

348
00:20:09,698 --> 00:20:11,233
I wouldn't bother.

349
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:12,367
Excuse me?

350
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:14,069
[Mark] Sounds like
a duck hunt to me.

351
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:15,602
Uh, Mark, why don't we let
Colonel Foster finish...

352
00:20:15,604 --> 00:20:18,139
A decoy. A diversion.

353
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:19,907
Look, they've already got Emma
and the ORCA.

354
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:22,276
Why would they want just this
one when they've got the keys

355
00:20:22,278 --> 00:20:25,813
to your entire magic kingdom
of horrors back here?

356
00:20:25,815 --> 00:20:28,483
I think that they want you
to go after this Mothra

357
00:20:28,485 --> 00:20:30,718
so they can go
after a real prize.

358
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,553
Something bigger.

359
00:20:32,555 --> 00:20:34,254
Right.

360
00:20:34,256 --> 00:20:35,391
Mark,

361
00:20:36,524 --> 00:20:37,892
this is not the first specimen
they've captured.

362
00:20:37,894 --> 00:20:39,127
They know what they are doing.

363
00:20:39,129 --> 00:20:40,561
[Mark] That's not
just a specimen.

364
00:20:40,563 --> 00:20:42,196
I've got an ex-wife
and a daughter out there,

365
00:20:42,198 --> 00:20:43,531
in case you forgot.

366
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,934
No. No one has
forgotten that, Mark,

367
00:20:45,936 --> 00:20:47,135
but, uh, to remind you,

368
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:48,569
you were brought on here

369
00:20:48,571 --> 00:20:50,204
to help track the ORCA,
and to advise us...

370
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:53,608
I advise you to kill
these things. All of 'em.

371
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,244
Especially him.

372
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:56,512
You wanna make sure
these things

373
00:20:56,514 --> 00:20:58,080
don't fall
into the wrong hands?

374
00:20:58,082 --> 00:20:59,914
You kill them
and the ORCA's useless.

375
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,583
Emma wouldn't have
wanted that.

376
00:21:02,585 --> 00:21:04,019
Even to save her life.

377
00:21:04,021 --> 00:21:05,352
Well, it wouldn't be
the first time

378
00:21:05,354 --> 00:21:07,488
Emma put all of this
before herself

379

or her family, would it?

380

488
00:27:32,842 --> 00:27:34,775
Oh, yeah, sure.
Let's bring him in for a beer.

489
00:27:34,777 --> 00:27:37,411
You out of your goddamn mind?

490
00:27:37,413 --> 00:27:39,282
Let him know
we're not a threat.

491
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:42,186
Open the shields.

492
00:27:47,756 --> 00:27:48,758
Do it.

493
00:28:23,325 --> 00:28:25,627
Hey, what's with
the light show?

494
00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:28,696
It's an intimidation display.

495
00:28:28,698 --> 00:28:31,331
Like a gorilla
pounding his chest.

496
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:33,367
[Sam] Consider us very

497
00:28:33,369 --> 00:28:34,905
intimidated.

498
00:28:36,573 --> 00:28:38,775
I don't think it's for us.

499
00:28:47,417 --> 00:28:48,952
What are you doing, dude?

500
00:28:59,595 --> 00:29:01,597
[Faint bellowing]

501
00:29:11,506 --> 00:29:13,310
[all sigh with relief]

502
00:29:16,979 --> 00:29:18,481
[Sam] Well,
that was interesting.

503
00:29:19,748 --> 00:29:20,750
Jesus!

504
00:29:30,526 --> 00:29:32,696
Can we maybe
close the shield now?

505
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:36,429
Show me
his territorial routes.

506
00:29:36,431 --> 00:29:37,965
What? Why?

507
00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:39,867
Because I wanna start
a boat tour. Just show me.

508
00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:42,035
- [Rick] Okay. Coming up.
- [Typing]

509
00:29:42,037 --> 00:29:44,071
You care to tell us
what you're looking for?

510
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,006
[Mark] When an animal leaves
its hunting ground,

511
00:29:46,008 --> 00:29:48,042
it's usually because
it's threatened by something.

512
00:29:48,044 --> 00:29:49,511
Run a course projection.

513
00:29:49,513 --> 00:29:51,011
[Mark] We gotta go after him.

514
00:29:51,013 --> 00:29:53,082
He's looking for something
out there.

515
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,485
It could be the ORCA.

516
00:29:58,053 --> 00:30:00,788
Doctor Stanton,
what's your projection?

517
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,860
[Rick] All paths have him
landing in the same place.

518
00:30:05,594 --> 00:30:06,860
Antarctica.

519
00:30:06,862 --> 00:30:08,228
Good, then.

520
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,967
I mean, let's go!
Let's go find him. Let's...

521
00:30:12,301 --> 00:30:15,269
Wait, what's in Antarctica?

522
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,369
[Foster] Barnes,

523
00:30:16,371 --> 00:30:18,571
contact the <i>Argo.</i>

524
00:30:18,573 --> 00:30:19,810
Yes, ma'am.

525
00:30:31,053 --> 00:30:33,120
[Dr. Graham]
<i>The specimen at this site</i>

526
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:35,022
has been kept
entirely off-book.

527
00:30:35,024 --> 00:30:37,324
And since it's
a more recent discovery,

528
00:30:37,326 --> 00:30:39,593
our data is limited.

529
00:30:39,595 --> 00:30:42,329
But it seems to be
another apex predator.

530
00:30:42,331 --> 00:30:44,898
Emma called it Monster Zero.

531
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,267
[Dr. Graham] It may have been
a rival alpha to Godzilla.

532
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:50,103
Battling for dominance
over the other Titans.

533
00:30:50,105 --> 00:30:51,572
Doctor Chen?

534
00:30:51,574 --> 00:30:54,140
I've been scouring through
thousands of years

535
00:30:54,142 --> 00:30:55,676
of myths and legends.

536
00:30:55,678 --> 00:30:58,279
But it's almost as if
people were scared

537
00:30:58,281 --> 00:30:59,847
to even write about it.

538
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:02,448
As if it was meant
to be forgotten.

539
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,650
Sorry, I hate to crash
a party,

540
00:31:03,652 --> 00:31:04,918
but I got some bad news.

541
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,553
You could just say news.
It's always bad.

542
00:31:06,555 --> 00:31:07,955
We lost Godzilla.

543
00:31:07,957 --> 00:31:09,990
He dropped off the scan
near Venezuela.

544
00:31:09,992 --> 00:31:11,091
Dropped off?

545
00:31:11,093 --> 00:31:12,426
I'm telling you,
Doctor Brooks was right.

546
00:31:12,428 --> 00:31:13,727
It's a Hollow Earth.

547
00:31:13,729 --> 00:31:15,629
That's how he moves around
so fast

548
00:31:15,631 --> 00:31:18,800
using these underwater tunnels
like wormholes.

No, Doctor Stanton,

814
00:49:51,546 --> 00:49:53,213
<i>the exact opposite.</i>

815
00:49:53,215 --> 00:49:56,115
<i>Just like how a forest fire
replenishes the soil</i>

816
00:49:56,117 --> 00:49:58,718
<i>or how a volcano
creates new land,</i>

817
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,454
<i>we have seen signs that these
creatures will do the same.</i>

818
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:05,291
<i>San Francisco, Las Vegas,
wherever the Titans go,</i>

819
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:08,995
<i>life follows,
triggered by their radiation.</i>

820
00:50:08,997 --> 00:50:11,164
<i>They are the only thing
that can reverse</i>

821
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:13,033
<i>the destruction
that we started.</i>

822
00:50:13,035 --> 00:50:17,169
<i>They are the only guarantee
that life will carry on.</i>

823
00:50:17,171 --> 00:50:20,405
<i>But for that to happen,
we must set them free.</i>

824
00:50:20,407 --> 00:50:22,175
You are murdering the world.

825
00:50:22,177 --> 00:50:23,410
[Emma] <i>No.</i>

826
00:50:23,412 --> 00:50:25,510
<i>Because as difficult
as this will be,</i>

827
00:50:25,512 --> 00:50:28,414
<i>I promise
humanity will not go extinct.</i>

828
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:33,019
<i>Using the ORCA, we will return
to a natural order.</i>

829
00:50:33,021 --> 00:50:35,555
<i>A forgotten order,
where we coexisted</i>

830
00:50:35,557 --> 00:50:37,323
<i>in balance with the Titans.</i>

831
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,258
<i>The first gods.</i>

832
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,894
This is a dangerous path.

833
00:50:41,896 --> 00:50:45,131
You are meddling with forces
beyond our comprehension.

834
00:50:45,133 --> 00:50:47,166
Gambling with
the lives of billions!

835
00:50:47,168 --> 00:50:49,501
<i>And what are you gambling
with, Serizawa?</i>

836
00:50:49,503 --> 00:50:51,204
<i>Monarch is broken.</i>

837
00:50:51,206 --> 00:50:53,173
<i>It's on the verge of being
shut down by a government</i>

838
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,608
<i>whose only objective is to
eradicate the creatures.</i>

839
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:58,644
<i>And if that happens,
what will our chances be?</i>

840
00:50:58,646 --> 00:51:00,412
You are out
of your goddamn mind!

841
00:51:00,414 --> 00:51:02,282
<i>First, you put
our daughter's life in danger,</i>

842
00:51:02,284 --> 00:51:04,015
<i>and now you get to
decide the fate of the world.</i>

843
00:51:04,017 --> 00:51:06,519
- That's rich, Emma!
- I couldn't be more sane,

844
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,722
<i>and Madison
couldn't be stronger.</i>

845
00:51:08,724 --> 00:51:11,691
<i>After we lost Andrew,
I trained her to survive.</i>

846
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:14,928
<i>And at least now, she will
have a fighting chance.</i>

847
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:17,097
A fighting chance? Why don't
you listen to yourself?

848
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:19,265
<i>It's not all math, Emma.</i>

849
00:51:19,267 --> 00:51:21,100
<i>Some things,
you can't control.</i>

850
00:51:21,102 --> 00:51:23,738
<i>And there are some things
that you can't run from.</i>

851
00:51:25,173 --> 00:51:27,610
This won't bring him
back to us.

852
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:44,860
<i>I can only urge you all
to take refuge.</i>

853
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,459
<i>Over the last 60 years,</i>

854
00:51:47,461 --> 00:51:50,129
<i>Monarch has prepared bunkers
around the world</i>

855
00:51:50,131 --> 00:51:52,765
<i>to save
and restart civilization.</i>

856
00:51:52,767 --> 00:51:54,736
<i>I suggest you find them.</i>

857

That bitch.

858
00:52:03,278 --> 00:52:05,778
How long
until this thing lands?

859
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,113
Three minutes.

860
00:52:07,115 --> 00:52:08,682
[Rick] You might
want to rethink that.

861
00:52:08,684 --> 00:52:10,050
[Foster] Why?

862
00:52:10,052 --> 00:52:11,950
Something's not right.
Check this out.

863
00:52:11,952 --> 00:52:14,253
Emma's not at Isla de Mara.

864
00:52:14,255 --> 00:52:16,923
I mean, the signal's too weak
to be local.

865
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,691
She's bouncing it off
our satellites.

866
00:52:18,693 --> 00:52:21,093
They must be holed up
in one of our old bunkers.

867
00:52:21,095 --> 00:52:22,894
She could be anywhere.

868
00:52:22,896 --> 00:52:26,432
- [Alarm beeping]
- What is that?

869
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:30,470
Oh, Jesus! She shut down
the containment system.

870
00:52:30,472 --> 00:52:31,807
How much time do we have?

871
00:52:33,106 --> 00:52:34,573
Containment system bypassed.
We're patched in.

872

- Ready to broadcast the ORCA.

00:52:53,595 --> 00:52:55,195
[Madison] Mom, don't!

875
00:52:55,197 --> 00:52:58,296
I'm sorry, did a child
just tell you what to do?

876
00:52:58,298 --> 00:53:00,033
Maybe Dad is right.
Maybe this isn't the way.

877
00:53:00,035 --> 00:53:01,733
By all means, Doctor Russell,

878
00:53:01,735 --> 00:53:03,301
let's reconsider
our entire plan.

879
00:53:03,303 --> 00:53:05,004
Especially after telling
your friends about it.

880
00:53:05,006 --> 00:53:06,840
Madison, we talked about this.

881
00:53:06,842 --> 00:53:08,307
No, you said you were
gonna help people,

882
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:09,742
that you would let them
find shelter.

883
00:53:09,744 --> 00:53:13,079
We don't have time for this!

884
00:53:13,081 --> 00:53:15,015
Did you really think
this was gonna be easy?

885
00:53:15,017 --> 00:53:16,615
Painless?
Is that what you told her?

886
00:53:16,617 --> 00:53:18,117
Leave her out of this.

887
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:19,785
Why? You're the one
who pulled her into it.

888
00:53:19,787 --> 00:53:23,823
Madison, tell me, what exactly
did Mommy sell you on?

889
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,325
Some grand utopia?

890
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,193
Man and monster,
living together

891
00:53:27,195 --> 00:53:28,727
- in blissful harmony?
- [Alarm beeps]

[Winston] Sir, they're

It's now or never.

894
00:53:32,434 --> 00:53:37,104
Emma, you came to me.
This is your plan.

895
00:53:37,106 --> 00:53:39,039
We both want
to save the planet,

896
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:40,273
but everything is going to die

897

if we don't see it through.

898
00:53:42,309 --> 00:53:46,215
Please, at least let them
get to safety.

899
00:53:47,916 --> 00:53:51,086

[Dr. Chen] Yes. He's not

There are some things beyond

01:53:17,481 --> 01:53:18,884
To do what?

1774
01:53:21,686 --> 01:53:22,952
You sure about this?

1775
01:53:22,954 --> 01:53:24,686
[Mark] It's the only way
to save him.

1776
01:53:24,688 --> 01:53:26,388
We fix it, get on the osprey

1777
01:53:26,390 --> 01:53:27,990
and draw that thing away
from Godzilla.

1778
01:53:27,992 --> 01:53:30,027
Buy him time to get back
on his feet.

Mark, you've seen
what that thing can do.

1782
01:53:43,107 --> 01:53:45,910
I know. It'll be tight, but
we have to take that chance.

1783
01:53:52,784 --> 01:53:54,050
Are you good to go?

1784
01:53:54,052 --> 01:53:55,118
Yes.

1785
01:53:55,120 --> 01:53:56,952
All right. One, two,

[Mark] Come on, Emma. Let's go.

1793
01:54:16,174 --> 01:54:17,506
Okay. Take her. Take her!

1794
01:54:17,508 --> 01:54:18,940
I still have to activate it.

1795
01:54:18,942 --> 01:54:19,809
[Mark] What?

1796
01:54:19,811 --> 01:54:21,446
